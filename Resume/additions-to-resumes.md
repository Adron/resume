# Resume  Additions

This doc is a collection of pages/posts/docs I've written detailing work I've done in the past, elaborating more of some of the specifics of applications, projects, leadership, and related efforts. Eventually all of these I'll remove from this doc when they're ready for linking in my active short and long resumes.

Description for "Really Big Coffee Company"

Joined the team to build out and lead the engineering team tasked to build out a QR Code scanning technology to close the order cycle gap. This involved implementing a scanner technology with Scandit's technology into an existing .NET web based Angular and .NET web based React application. Add elaboration upon completion and shipping of said feature capability.

Make the mission/intro/description more concise while detailing wins, cost savings, money makers, team productivity improvements, and higher level work like that. Possibly break out different work and be sure to link the detailed descriptions of the different projects.
