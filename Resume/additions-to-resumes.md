# Resume  Additions

This doc is a collection of pages/posts/docs I've written detailing work I've done in the past, elaborating more of some of the specifics of applications, projects, leadership, and related efforts. Eventually all of these I'll remove from this doc when they're ready for linking in my active short and long resumes.

Links to add to resumes:
