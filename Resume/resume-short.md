## Experience

### Principal Engineer (Architect, Consultant, Trainer)
CTC - Owner/Consultant
February 2023 - Present | Redmond, WA - Remote

Clients Include: [Tata Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Communications), [Kaleyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleyra), [PNC Bank](https://www.pnc.com/), [Vaco](https://www.vaco.com/), [Incedo](https://www.incedoinc.com/), and others.

Architecture, design, and prototyping of Data Fabric Platform ([More details](https://compositecode.blog/financial-services-data-fabric/)) buy/build technologies for modernization of APIs. This involves working across teams and customers in financial organizations to ensure design elements meet requirements of data consumers and management capabilities of the respective organization, while ensuring ROI is met and measured.

Setting up groups within the organization around Communities of Practice. Specifically GraphQL Community of Practice and Java Spring Boot Community of Practice. ([More details](https://compositecode.blog/communities-of-practice-transforming-financial-software-development/))

Where necessary implementing vertical application stacks for reference and prototyping with horizontal infrastructure as code assets for scaling, resiliency, deployment, management, and ongoing iterative development of Java Spring Boot based APIs via containerized (Docker/K8s) with continuous deployment.

Planning, organizing, and mentoring where needed for a wide array of data sources including Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and other data source options as necessary.

Hiring and building teams for multiple projects centered around financial organizations application API modernization (going from X tech to RESTful & GraphQL APIs, custom resolvers, etc).

Leading multiple projects for teams; including scoping, identifying statement of work, user experience outcomes desired, initial product planning, building the right team with right hard and soft skills, and aligning them with the mission at hand.

Advocating technical solutions across teams internally through a Community of Practice for GraphQL (and related technologies). Grew the community from a small dozen to over 60 people in just a couple of weeks. Community is now going to exceed 80 members by our 4th month! For internal growth this is an excellent growth path among the data teams!

Created and built out some internal corporate training focused around deployment solutions & plans using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) based on immutable infrastructure concepts.

### Principal Product Manager
Hasura - Full Time
April 2022 - February 2023 | Seattle, WA - Remote

Check out the work @ Hasura for the data source connections here > https://hasura.io/graphql/database/

I rejoined Hasura to become a starting member of a new product management team. I worked to help the team move from a lack of process, to a more process focused product practice. I led and contributed to discussions around customers, use case, design decisions, and product clearing the path and leading engineering for new feature and capabilities development.

In addition to the product specific roles I worked with engineering to streamline the flow and practice of the engineering process too. This included synchronizing tooling of Productboard and JIRA between engineering and the product team. With the tooling synchronized and an agreed upon work flow we were able to shift gears, improve communication, and push forward new feature development in a more consistent, quality, and clear path form inception, ideation, development, and "done".

Projects helping startups initiate their first technical hires, team hiring, and further build out.

I've pushed businesses forward using lean startup approaches, focused on quality, user experience, and putting together teams of people (coders, graphic design, user experience, and other roles) that can get products built and deployed with the capabilities and features needed. Offering & routinely providing hands on initial coding, prototyping, and related work for startups moving toward MVP and v1 of their offering.

The approach I take has been technology neutral. However there have been some that are routinely called for including; Go, Node.js, and JavaScript for multi-tier web development (React). 

### Principal Software Engineer, SRE, & Open Source Ethnographer
Home Depot - Full Time
Orchards, WA - Hybrid

For a good idea of what I worked on during my time at Home Depot check out the following blog entries:
 - https://compositecode.blog/2016/01/26/all-that-tech-sitrep-elastic-meetup-and-quote-center-updates/
 - https://compositecode.blog/2015/10/31/after-816-days-im-taking-a-job/

A few high points: Researching the cultural changes and characteristics for building an effective organization around open source development. Determining what is and what won't work for the team specifically. Implementing techniques and ideas around pushing code from a close source development practice to an open source development practice. I also presented in October on this specifically at O'Reilly Architecture Conference in London, and have slides and information here: https://compositecode.blog/confs-meetups-events/moving-enterprise-practices-and-development-to-open-source/

Technology high points: Terraform, Packer, Golang, Node.js/JavaScript, Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack, Distributed Systems, etc. Migration from an OpenStack Platform to Google Cloud Platform, Architectural Changes from vertical scaling to horizontal scaling cloud architectures and more.

At CDK I led two teams; one team of interns and on mid-level and senior devs on two distinct efforts.

1. Build out, navigate CDK's internal *infrastructure*, and determine was is needed to deploy a push notification server.
2. Lead an effort among interns and staff for the *challenge* series. This involved determining use case, product fit, and options for deployment of various applications CDK teams could use internally.

*Projects at Code Fellows (Feburary 2015 - April 2015)*

I worked with Code Fellows to start up the Portland branch of the Code Fellows School. During this time I worked as the initial instructor with a team opening up the office and providing the first multi-week long training sessions.

The sessions were based on core web development skills needed to attain a junior level development position. This included the standard trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a further dive into various frameworks, libraries, and other tooling one would work with to build out various sites.

Supporting courses included Git, IDEs, and related curriculum and materials to round out the student's education.

*Project at New Relic (March 2012-November 2014)*

NOTE: This work was done while also running a startup (see Deconstructed below), since we both had numerous parallels and teamed up to do that work.

Working with New Relic I've produced a number of individual and series of blog articles (http://blog.newrelic.com/) based around Platform as a Service (PaaS) Technologies, Node.js Applications and deployments and a number of other various topics.

With the articles I've written for New Relic there have been a number of others for related publications that I've written in conjunction with New Relic. These publications include; Mashable, Silicon Angle, Read, Write, Web, and others. Links to those articles can be found here: https://compositecode.blog/write-up-series/my-work-elsewhere/

Tier 2 + New Relic - worked on integration and data collection of APM tooling, with their teams to integrate with PAAS environments like Cloud Foundry.
Worked with New Relic & Basho for tooling integration around the Riak distributed database and the New Relic APM tooling.
