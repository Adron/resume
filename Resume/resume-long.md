## Experience

### Principal Engineer (Architect, Consultant, Trainer)
CTC - Owner/Consultant
February 2023 - Present
Redmond, WA - Remote

Clients Include: [Tata Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Communications), [Kaleyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleyra), [PNC Bank](https://www.pnc.com/), [Vaco](https://www.vaco.com/), [Incedo](https://www.incedoinc.com/), and others.

Architecture, design, and prototyping of Data Fabric Platform ([See full description here]()) buy/build technologies for modernization of APIs. This involves working across teams and customers in financial organizations to ensure design elements meet requirements of data consumers and management capabilities of the respective organization, while ensuring ROI is met and measured.

Where necessary implementing vertical application stacks for reference and prototyping with horizontal infrastructure as code assets for scaling, resiliency, deployment, management, and ongoing iterative development of Java Spring Boot based APIs via containerized (Docker/K8s) with continuous deployment.

Planning, organizing, and mentoring where needed for a wide array of data sources including Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and other data source options as necessary.

Hiring and building teams for multiple projects centered around financial organizations application API modernization (going from X tech to RESTful & GraphQL APIs).

Leading multiple projects for teams; including scoping, identifying statement of work, user experience outcomes desired, initial product planning, building the right team with right hard and soft skills, and aligning them with the mission at hand.

Advocating technical solutions across teams internally through a Community of Practice for GraphQL (and related technologies). Grew the community from a small dozen to over 60 people in just a couple of weeks. Community is now going to exceed 80 members by our 4th month! For internal growth this is an excellent growth path among the data teams!

Created and built out some internal corporate training focused around deployment solutions & plans using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) based on immutable infrastructure concepts.

### Principal Product Manager
Hasura - Full Time
April 2022 - February 2023
Seattle, WA - Remote

Check out the work @ Hasura for the data source connections here > https://hasura.io/graphql/database/

I rejoined Hasura to become a starting member of a new product management team. I worked to help the team move from a lack of process, to a more process focused product practice. I led and contributed to discussions around customers, use case, design decisions, and product clearing the path and leading engineering for new feature and capabilities development.

In addition to the product specific roles I worked with engineering to streamline the flow and practice of the engineering process too. This included synchronizing tooling of Productboard and JIRA between engineering and the product team. With the tooling synchronized and an agreed upon work flow we were able to shift gears, improve communication, and push forward new feature development in a more consistent, quality, and clear path form inception, ideation, development, and "done".

From a tactical level several key features were released under my helm:

1. Instant GraphQL on Amazon Athena ([link](https://hasura.io/blog/announcing-amazon-athena-integration))
2. Instant GraphQL on Snowflake ([link](https://hasura.io/blog/introducing-instant-graphql-apis-for-snowflake-cloud-data-platform))

### Principal Cloud Architect / Principal Developer Advocate
DataStax - Full Time

*Principal Cloud Architect during December 2019 - August 2020*

90% Providing architectural plans (design), guidance (team leadership & coordination), and implementation (coding) of DataStax's Apache Cassandra DBaaS. My main area of focus has been on GraphQL API implementation, reference application guidance, technical content, and leading efforts around prospective customer and user outreach for these services.

*Principal Developer Advocate during June 2018 - December 2019*

Worked with the team on a number of key advocacy projects for DataStax:

1. Build out, expansion of material, and presentation of reference application designs and guides for building large scale (often microservice based) enterprise applications using the killrvideo code base. Used the repos with Java, C#, Node.js, and Python for use in presentation, teaching, mentoring, and related outreach.
2. Started, led, and organized various meetups in Seattle region around regular presentations, but also around teaching database and data-centric development topics around data modeling, architecture, and related design and coding.
3. Regular technical content blogging, and other content creation, around open source projects, contributions to open source projects, and related events with the software programming/language communities.

4. Led efforts to start live-stream coding on Twitch. This led to me starting a YouTube & Twitch channel to share coding sessions, building and contributing to open source, and other involvement around various Apache Cassandra, data, data management, and related focuses. This expanded into a wide range of streaming around Go, C#, JavaScript/Node.js, Apache Cassandra, DataStax Enterprise, distributed system, Terraform, operational and development related (i.e. DevOps) projects and lots more besides just coding.
