The following posts, are the highly detailed descriptions - or more specifically - the stories of the projects that I've worked on. I've wanted to detail these for years. Now, I'm finally getting down to writing these up. There are two purposes that I'm writing these up, one is that it is in many cases the projects have interesting stories behind them, and secondly I want to document the projects for my own reference for the detail of the tech (when it's reasonble to provide the details that is).
